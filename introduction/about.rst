=============
What is Axe?
=============

Axe aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Axe network features 
:ref:`instant transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend 
protection, :ref:`anonymity <privatesend>` equal to that of physical 
cash, a 
:ref:`self-governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` 
driven by :ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` for on-chain
scaling to up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source
hardware. While Axe is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key
components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure
offers significant improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and
governance. This section of the documentation describes these and many
more key features that set Axe apart in the blockchain economy.

.. _whitepaper:

Whitepaper
----------

The Axe Whitepaper describes the unique value proposition and key
innovations in Axe from an academic and theoretical perspective. It is 
a living document maintained as a GitHub wiki, receiving ongoing updates 
and frequent community translations as new features are implemented. 
Various other whitepapers describing particular features in additional 
detail and (for historical reasons) the original whitepaper are 
available for download as PDF files.
