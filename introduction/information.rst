Glossary
========

51% Attack
  A condition in which more than half the computing power on a
  cryptocurrency network is controlled by a single miner or group of
  miners. That amount of power theoretically makes them the authority on
  the network. This means that every client on the network believes the
  attacker’s hashed transaction block.

Address
  An Axe address is used to :ref:`Send/Receive a Payment
  <axecore-send-receive>` on the Axe network. It contains a string of
  alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable QR
  code. An Axe address is also the public key in the pair of keys used
  by Axe holders to digitally sign transactions (see Public key).

Algorithm
  In mathematics and computer science, an `algorithm
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>`_ is a self-contained
  step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform
  calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.

Altcoin
  Since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and has the largest market
  capitalization, it is considered as the reference. An altcoin, or
  alternative coin, is any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.

AML
  Anti-Money Laundering techniques are used to stop people from making
  illegally obtained funds appear as though they have been earned
  legally. AML mechanisms can be legal or technical in nature.
  Regulators frequently apply AML techniques to Axe exchanges.

API
  In computer programming, an `application programming interface (API)
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_ is
  a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and
  applications.

  An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations,
  inputs, outputs, and underlying types, defining functionalities that
  are independent of their respective implementations, which allows
  definitions and implementations to vary without compromising the
  interface. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by
  providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the
  programmer.

ASIC
  An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), is an integrated
  circuit (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for
  general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital
  voice recorder or for :ref:`high-efficiency Axe mining <asic-mining>`
  is an ASIC.

Backlog
  Backlog generally refers to an accumulation over time of work waiting
  to be done or orders to be fulfilled.

Backup
  The process of making copies of a computer file to ensure its
  integrity in case of loss, theft, or damage. Axe allows users to
  :ref:`make backup copies <axecore-backup>` of their digital wallets.
  This protects against losing one's money in the event of a computer
  crashing or losing one’s mobile device. This would be the equivalent
  of being able to backup the cash in your wallet, so that if you lost
  it, you could restore the cash from a backup.

Bitcoin 2.0
  This is a term explaining the next new level of Bitcoin projects which
  started as a fork of Bitcoin but extended their code into the next
  level of Blockchain Projects (Smart Contracts, Decentralised
  Voting,....)

Blockchain
  A `blockchain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)>`_
  is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list
  of data records hardened against tampering and revision. It consists
  of data structure blocks — which exclusively hold data in initial
  blockchain implementations, and both data and programs in some of the
  more recent implementations — with each block holding batches of
  individual transactions and the results of any blockchain executables.
  Each block contains a timestamp and information linking it to a
  previous block.

Blocks
  Transactions on the Blockchain are collected in "`blocks
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)#Blocks>`_" which
  record and confirm when and in what sequence transactions enter and
  are logged in the block chain. Blocks are created by users known as
  "miners" who use specialized software or equipment designed
  specifically to create blocks.

Budget System / DGBB
  The development of Axe and the Axe ecosystem is self-funded by the
  network. Each time a block is discovered, 45% of the block reward goes
  to miners and 45% goes to masternodes. Ten percent is withheld by the
  network and used to fund projects that are approved by the masternode
  network. This process is known as :ref:`Decentralized Governance by
  Blockchain <governance>` (DGBB). For a fee, anybody can submit a
  proposal to the network, and will be paid directly by the blockchain
  if approved by the masternodes. The Budget System is sometimes called
  the Treasury System; the two terms are interchangeable.

ChainLock
  Defined in `DIP8
  <https://github.com/axerunners/dips/blob/master/dip-0008.md>`__,
  ChainLocks are a method of using an LLMQ to threshold sign a block
  immediately after it is propogated by the miner in order to enforce
  the first-seen rule. This is a powerful method of mitigating 51%
  mining attacks, which are associated with double spending.

Cloud Wallet
  Third parties that will store your Axe on their servers for you, so
  that you can access your funds from any device connected to the
  internet. If their website is hacked or if their servers are damaged,
  you run the risk of losing your Axe. Any online wallets should be
  secured with strong passphrases and 2FA. You cannot make backup copies
  of your online wallet, because you do not have access to the private
  keys. We do not recommend that you store large quantities of funds in
  online wallets.

Coinbase transaction
  The first transaction in a block. Always created by a miner, it
  includes a single input which constitutes the block reward. This is
  split between the miner and a deterministically chosen masternode.

Cold Storage
  A method of generating and storing private keys completely offline.
  One could use a desktop or laptop computer disconnected from the
  internet, a dedicated hardware wallet, a USB stick, or a :ref:`paper
  wallet <axe-paper-wallet>`.

Confirm(ed) Transaction
  When a Axe transaction is made, a miner must verify that the
  transaction is valid. When the inputs and outputs are verified, the
  transaction is included in a block in the blockchain. The transaction
  can then be considered complete and irreversible. The confirmation
  number increases as more blocks are added to the blockchain.

Confirmation Number
  The number of confirmations for a specific Axe transaction. Zero
  confirmations means that the **transaction is unconfirmed**. One
  confirmation means that the transaction is included in the latest
  block in the blockchain. Two confirmations means the transaction is
  included in two blocks, three confirmations for three blocks, and so
  on. The probability of a transaction being reversed (double spent)
  diminishes exponentially with every block and subsequent confirmation.
  Six confirmations is usually considered "safe" and irreversible.

Confirmed Transactions
  Transactions that are processed by miners and considered irreversible,
  usually after six confirmations. In the case of InstantSend, funds can
  be considered irreversible after a few seconds, but must still be
  written to the blockchain (and thus "confirmed").

CPU
  A `central processing unit (CPU)
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit>`_ is the
  electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the
  instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic,
  logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the
  instructions. The term has been used in the computer industry at least
  since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a
  processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit
  (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external
  components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

Cryptocurrency
  A `cryptocurrency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency>`_ (or
  crypto currency or crypto-currency) is a medium of exchange using
  cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of
  new units.

Cryptography
  Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek κρυπτός *kryptós*, "hidden,
  secret"; and γράφειν *graphein*, "writing," or -λογία *-logia*,
  "study," respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for
  secure communication in the presence of third parties called
  adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and
  analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from
  reading private messages; various aspects in information security such
  as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-
  repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography
  exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer
  science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography
  include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

DAP
  Decentralized Application Protocol. This term describes an application
  running on top of the Axe DAPI platform.

DAP Client
  An HTTP Client that connects to DAPI and enables Axe blockchain users
  to read and write data to their DAP Space.

DAP Schema
  A Axe Schema document extending the Axe System Schema to define
  consensus data and rules within a DAP contract.

DAP Space
  The part of a DAP State that is owned by a specific blockchain user.
  Data in a DAP Space can only be changed by the owner.

DAP State
  The total set of data stored in a DAP. This data consists of user
  DAP Spaces.

DAPI
  Decentralized Application Programming Interface. See above for a
  definition of API. DAPI will perform the same functions as an API, but
  with quorums of masternodes acting as the endpoints for API
  communication.

Dark Gravity Wave
  In concept, :ref:`Dark Gravity Wave (DGW) <dark-gravity-wave>` is
  similar to *Kimoto Gravity Well*, adjusting the difficulty levels
  every block (instead of every 2016 blocks like Bitcoin) by using
  statistical data of the last blocks found. In this way block issuing
  times can remain consistent despite fluctuations in hashpower. However
  it doesn't suffer from the time-warp exploit.

Axe
  AXE is a decentralized X11-based cryptocurrency. The foundation of 
  AXE network is hybrid PoW/PoSe system. First-tier nodes provide hash power
  to move data and secure the blockchain, while the second tier of full nodes
  adds extra privacy and increases network performance. 
  Axe's features include PrivateSend, InstantSend,  Decentralized Governance
  by Blockchain (DGBB), a 2nd tier network  (referred to as the masternode network).
  See the :ref:`Features <features>` page for a full list of Axe's features.

Axe Client
  Axe clients are software programs used to interface with the Axe
  network. They store the private keys needed to conduct Axe
  transactions as well as a copy of the entire blockchain. A Axe client
  connects to the Axe network and becomes a node in the network. A node
  shares and propagates new transactions with the rest of the network,
  creating a robust decentralized infrastructure.

Axe Core Wallet
  The :ref:`Axe Core Wallet <axe-core-wallet>` (known also as the QT
  wallet) is the "official" Axe wallet that is compiled by the Axe
  Core Team and allows both PrivateSend and InstantSend. The AxeCore
  wallet will download the entire blockchain and serve it over the
  internet to any peers who request it.

Axe Schema
  A JSON-based language specification for defining and validating
  consensus data in Evolution.

DDoS
  A distributed denial of service attack uses large numbers of computers
  under an attacker’s control to drain the resources of a central
  target. They often send small amounts of network traffic across the
  Internet to tie up computing and bandwidth resources at the target,
  which prevents it from providing services to legitimate users. Axe
  exchanges have sometimes been hit with DDoS attacks.

Decentralized
  `Decentralized computing
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing>`_ is the
  allocation of resources, both hardware and software, to each
  individual workstation or office location. In contrast, centralized
  computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out or
  obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing
  is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite
  of centralized computing, which was prevalent during the early days of
  computers. A decentralized computer system has many benefits over a
  conventional centralized network. Desktop computers have advanced so
  rapidly that their potential performance far exceeds the requirements
  of most business applications. This results in most desktop computers
  remaining nearly idle most of the time. A decentralized system can use
  the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency. However, it is
  debatable whether these networks increase overall effectiveness.

Desktop Wallet
  A wallet is a piece of software that stores your Axe. There are many
  different wallet options, but it is imperative to choose a secure one.
  We recommend any of the following: :ref:`Axe Core Wallet
  <axe-core-wallet>` / :ref:`Axe Electrum Wallet
  <axe-electrum-wallet>` / :ref:`Hardware Wallets <hardware-wallets>`


Difficulty
  This number determines how difficult it is to hash a new block. It is
  related to the maximum allowed number in a given numerical portion of
  a transaction block’s hash. The lower the number, the more difficult
  it is to produce a hash value that fits it. Difficulty varies based on
  the amount of computing power used by miners on the Axe network. If
  large numbers of miners leave a network, the difficulty would
  decrease. Axe's increasing popularity and the availability of
  specialized ASIC miners have caused the difficulty to increase over
  time.

Digital Wallet
  See :ref:`this link <wallets>` for full documentation on wallets.

  A digital wallet is similar to a physical wallet except that it is
  used to hold **digital currency**. A Axe wallet holds your private
  keys, which allow you to spend your Axe. You are also able to make
  backups of your wallet in order to ensure that you never lose access
  to your Axe. Digital wallets can exist in many different forms and on
  many devices:

  - **Desktop Wallet** (:ref:`Axe Electrum Wallet
    <axe-electrum-wallet>`, :ref:`Axe Core Wallet
    <axe-core-wallet>`): Wallet programs that you install on a laptop
    or desktop computer. You are solely responsible for protecting the
    wallet file and the private keys it contains. Make backup copies of
    your wallet files to ensure that you don't lose access to your
    funds.

  - **Mobile Wallet** (:ref:`Android <axe-android-wallet>`, :ref:`iOS
    <axe-ios-wallet>`): These wallets can be downloaded through Google
    Play or Apple (iTunes) App Stores. Mobile wallets allow you to use
    Axe on-the-go by scanning a QR code to send payment. Make backup
    copies of your mobile wallet files to ensure that you don't lose
    access to your funds. Due to security issues with mobile phones, it
    is advised that you don't store large amounts of funds on these
    wallets.

   - **Hardware Wallets** (:ref:`Trezor <hardware-wallets>`, KeepKey,
    Ledger, Nano): A hardware wallet is a specialized, tamper-proof,
    hardware device that stores your private keys. This device is able
    to sign transactions with your private key without being connected
    to the internet. However, you must have an internet connection to
    send the transaction to the Axe network. This allows your private
    keys to be accessed easily while still keeping them securely
    protected. This is widely regarded to be the safest form of storage
    for your Axe.

  - **Offline/Cold Storage** (:ref:`Paper wallet <axe-paper-wallet>`):
    A special wallet that is created offline and is never exposed to the
    internet. Accomplished by using software to generate a public and
    private key offline and then recording the generated keys. They keys
    can be printed out on paper or even laser-etched in metal. Copies
    can be made and stored in a personal safe or bank deposit box. This
    is an extremely secure way to store Axe. There is no risk of using
    software wallet files, which can become corrupt, or web wallets,
    which can be hacked. NOTE: USB sticks are not safe for long-term
    (multi-year) storage because they degrade over time.

DKG
  Defined in `DIP6
  <https://github.com/axerunners/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md>`__,
  Distributed Key Generation (`DKG
  <https://github.com/axerunners/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md#llmq-dkg-network-protocol>`__)
  is a method of generating a BLS key pair for use in an LLMQ to perform
  threshold signing on network messages. It is based on BLS M-of-N
  Threshold Scheme and Distributed Key Generation, which is an
  implementation of Shamir’s Secret Sharing.

Digital Signature
  A digital signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to
  prove their identity or ownership of a digital asset. When your
  digital wallet signs a transaction with the appropriate private key,
  the whole network can see that the signature matches the address of
  the Axe being spent, without the need to reveal the private key to
  the network. You can also digitally sign messages using your private
  key, to prove for instance that you are the owner of a certain Axe
  address.

Electrum Wallet
  :ref:`Axe Electrum Wallet <axe-electrum-wallet>` is a lightweight
  wallet that does not require you to download or sync the entire
  blockchain, making the wallet lighter and faster. However, it is
  missing certain features such as PrivateSend and InstantSend.

Encryption
  In cryptography, `encryption
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption>`_ is the process of
  encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized
  parties can read it. Encrypted messages which are intercepted by a
  third-party are indecipherable gibberish without the private key. In
  an encryption scheme, the *plaintext* message is encrypted using an
  encryption algorithm, generating *ciphertext* that can only be read if
  decrypted by the intended recipient. For technical reasons, an
  encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key
  generated by an algorithm. Increases in computing power have "broken"
  many past encryption algorithms, but a well-designed modern system
  such as AES-256 is considered essentially "uncrackable."

Escrow Services
  An `escrow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow>`_ is:

  - a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and
    disburses money or documents for the primary transacting parties,
    with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the
    transacting parties; or

  - an account established by a broker for holding funds on behalf of
    the broker's principal or some other person until the consummation
    or termination of a transaction; or

  - a trust account held in the borrower's name to pay obligations such
    as property taxes and insurance premiums.

  A trusted escrow service is often used when purchasing cryptocurrency
  or other goods/services over the internet. Both the buyer and seller
  will choose a trusted third-party, the seller will send the item (or
  currency) to the escrow agent, and the buyer will send the purchasing
  funds to the escrow agent as well. Once the escrow agent is satisfied
  that both parties have satisfied the terms of the agreement, he/she
  will forward the funds and the product (or currency) being purchased
  to the appropriate party.

Exchange
  The current price of one Axe compared to the price of other
  currencies, like the US dollar, Yen, Euro, or Bitcoin. Because most
  trading volume takes place on the BTC/AXE markets, price is often
  quoted in fractions of a bitcoin. For instance, the price of one Axe
  at the end of March 2017 was 0.08 (bitcoins per Axe). An excellent
  site for following the exchange rate of Axe is `CoinMarketCap
  <https://coinmarketcap.com/>`_. Businesses wishing to reduce the risk
  of holding a volatile digital currency can avoid that risk altogether
  by having a payment processor do an instant exchange at the time of
  each transaction.

Faucet
  Faucets are a reward system, in the form of a website or app, that
  dispenses rewards in the form of a microaxe or Duff, which is a
  hundredth of a millionth Axe, for visitors to claim in exchange for
  completing a captcha or task as described by the website.

Fiat Gateway
  `Fiat money <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money>`_ has been
  defined variously as:

  - Any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
  - State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
  - Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.

  Examples include the US dollar, the Euro, the Yen, and so forth.

Fintech
  `Financial technology
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology>`_, also known as
  FinTech, is an economic industry composed of companies that use
  technology to make financial services more efficient. Financial
  technology companies are generally startups trying to make financial
  processes more efficient or eliminate middle- men. Recently many
  fintech companies have begun utilizing blockchain technology, which is
  the same technology that underpins Axe and Bitcoin.

Fork
  When the blockchain diverges or splits, with some clients recognizing
  one version of the blockchain as valid, and other clients believing
  that a different version of the blockchain is valid. Most forks
  resolve themselves without causing any problems, because the longest
  blockchain is always considered to be valid. In time, one version of
  the blockchain will usually "win" and become universally recognized as
  valid. Forks can, however, be extremely dangerous and should be
  avoided if possible.

  Forking is most likely to occur during software updates to the
  network. Axe uses a Multi-Phased Fork (“:ref:`Spork <sporks>`”)
  system for greater flexibility and safety.

Full Nodes
  Any Axe client that is serving a full version of the blockchain to
  peers. This can be a user running a Axe Core wallet on his/her
  desktop, or it could be a :ref:`masternode <masternodes>`. Full nodes
  promote decentralization by allowing any user to double check the
  validity of the blockchain.

Fungible
  Every unit of the currency is worth the same as any other unit.

Genesis Block
  The very first block in the block chain.

GPU
  A `graphics processing unit (GPU)
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit>`_, also
  occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized
  electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to
  accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for
  output to a display. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones,
  personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are
  very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing,
  and their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than
  general- purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large
  blocks of data is done in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can
  be present on a video card, or it can be embedded on the motherboard
  or — in certain CPUs — on the CPU die. Certain cryptocurrencies use
  mining algorithms which are most efficiently run on GPUs.

Hardware Wallet
  :ref:`Hardware wallets <hardware-wallets>` are among the safest type
  of wallet for storing your Axe. Your private key is protected inside
  a piece of hardware, and is never exposed to the internet. You are
  still able to sign transactions as normal, making it both safe and
  convenient.

Hash
  A mathematical process that takes a variable amount of data and
  produces a shorter, fixed-length output. A hashing function has two
  important characteristics. First, it is mathematically difficult to
  work out what the original input was by looking at the output. Second,
  changing even the tiniest part of the input will produce an entirely
  different output.

Hashrate
  The number of hashes that can be performed by a Axe miner in a given
  period of time (usually a second).

Insight
  Blockchain information server used to power block explorers and
  respond to transaction queries.

InstantX
  See InstantSend

InstantSend
  :ref:`InstantSend <instantsend>` technology uses the masternode
  network to "lock" transaction inputs, preventing Axe from being
  double-spent. Unlike Bitcoin, where it takes an hour or longer for
  transactions to fully confirm, transactions using InstantSend are
  "locked" and irreversible after only a few seconds.

Liquidity
  The ability to buy and sell an asset easily, with pricing that stays
  roughly similar between trades. A suitably large community of buyers
  and sellers is important for liquidity. The result of an illiquid
  market is price volatility, and the inability to easily determine the
  value of an asset.

LLMQ
  Defined in `DIP6
  <https://github.com/axerunners/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md>`__, A Long-
  Living Masternode Quorum (LLMQ) is a deterministic subset of the
  global deterministic masternode list. Such a quorum is formed with the
  help of a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol and is supposed to
  be active for a long time (e.g. days). Multiple quorums are kept alive
  at the same time, allowing load balancing between these quorums. The
  main task of a LLMQ is to perform threshold signing of consensus
  related messages.

Masternode
  A :ref:`masternode <masternode-network>` is special type of full node
  that performs services for the network and is paid a portion of the
  block reward. Masternodes require proof of ownership of 1000 AXE.

  Masternodes serve as the second tier of the Axe network, and power
  InstantSend, PrivateSend, the Budget System.

Mining
  :ref:`Miners <mining>` process transactions on the Axe network and
  publish them on the blockchain. As a reward for doing this, miners are
  paid 45% of the block reward.

Mobile Wallet
  These are wallets available on mobile devices (iOS + Android).

MultiSig
  Multi-signature addresses provide additional security by requiring
  multiple people to sign a transaction with their private key before
  the transaction can be sent. For example, in :ref:`2 of 3 multisig
  <axecore-multisig>`, two out of three possible signatories have to
  sign a transaction for it to be processed. Multi-signature addresses
  are commonly used by exchanges and other organizations that are in
  possession of large sums of cryptocurrency, since it makes theft much
  more difficult.

Node
  A node is any device running Axe wallet software. Full nodes are
  software clients that have downloaded the entire blockchain and serve
  it to other clients on Axe's peer-to-peer network.

OTC
  Over the counter (OTC) trades are trades that occur off exchanges. In
  an OTC trade, a buyer and seller trade with each other directly, or
  through an intermediary. OTC trading is useful when a person wants to
  either buy or sell a large amount of cryptocurrency and is afraid that
  a large buy or sell order will move the price (called "slippage").

P2P
  Peer-to-peer. Decentralized interactions that happen between at least
  two parties in a highly interconnected network. An alternative system
  to a 'hub-and-spoke' arrangement, in which all participants in a
  transaction deal with each other through a single mediation point.

Paper Wallet
  :ref:`Paper wallets <axe-paper-wallet>` are offline wallets, printed
  on paper for safety. If properly secured and stored they are
  considered the safest way to store cryptocurrency.

Privacy
  `Privacy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy>`_ is the ability of
  an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about
  themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries
  and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and
  individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a
  person, it usually means that something is inherently special or
  sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps security
  (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use,
  as well as protection of information. Axe includes PrivateSend, which
  allows users to maintain financial privacy.

Private Key
  A `private key <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-
  key_cryptography>`_ is a long alphanumeric passcode that allows Axe
  to be spent. Every Axe wallet contains one or more private keys which
  are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically
  related to all Axe addresses generated for the wallet. Because the
  private key is the "ticket" that allows someone to spend Axe, it is
  important that these are kept secure and secret.

PrivateSend
  :ref:`PrivateSend <privatesend>` obscures the source of funds in order
  to maintain financial privacy between users. It can be turned on or
  off at the users' discretion.

Proof of Service - PoSe
  Consensus mechanism used in Axe to verify that a masternode has
  provided uninterrupted service meeting a minimum quality level to the
  network. Maintaining this service allows a masternode to enter and
  move up through the global list and eventually into the selection pool
  to receive payment.


Proof of Stake - PoS
  Consensus mechanism that relies on ownership of a cryptocurrency to
  maintain the blockchain. In Proof of Stake systems, each owner of the
  currency can use their wallet to "stake," and there's a small chance
  that they will be chosen to create the next block and add it to the
  chain. In this way consensus is maintained across all nodes. Proof of
  Stake saves electricity and does not require specialized computer
  hardware. It does however suffer from several pitfalls, including the
  "nothing at stake" problem. Since no electricity is consumed, in the
  event of an attack it is actually beneficial for Proof of Stake nodes
  to "vote" to accept both the legitimate chain and the attacker's
  chain.

Proof of Work - PoW
  Consensus mechanism that keeps all nodes honest by requiring
  computational power to be expended in order to create new blocks.
  Miners must use expensive equipment and burn electricity to add blocks
  to the blockchain. Without a consensus mechanism of some sort, any
  node could add blocks to the chain and the network's nodes would never
  agree on which chain was valid.

Public Key
  The `public key <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-
  key_cryptography>`_ is derived from the private key but is not secret
  and can be revealed to anybody. When a private key is used to sign
  messages, the public key is used to verify that the signature is
  valid.

Pump and dump
  Inflating the value of a financial asset that has been produced or
  acquired cheaply, often using aggressive publicity and misleading
  statements. The publicity causes others to acquire the asset, forcing
  up its value. When the value is high enough, the perpetrator sells
  their assets, cashing in and flooding the market, which causes the
  value to crash. This is particularly common in markets with low
  liquidity, such as some altcoins.

Quorum
  Group of masternodes signing or voting on some action, with the
  formation of the group determined by some determiniation algorithm.

QR Code
  A two-dimensional graphical block containing a monochromatic pattern
  representing a sequence of data. QR codes are designed to be scanned
  by cameras, including those found in mobile phones, and are frequently
  used to encode Axe addresses.

Satoshi Nakamoto
  `Satoshi Nakamoto <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto>`_
  is the name used by the person or people who designed Bitcoin and
  created its original reference implementation.

SDK
  Software Development Kit. A set of tools, code and documentation used
  by developers to create apps targeting a specific hardware or software
  platform.

State View
  The current state of all data objects once all changes from state
  transitions have been applied. Used in Evolution to determine what
  should be displayed in a given social wallet, for example.

Spork
  A Spork is a mechanism by which updated code is released to the network,
  but not immediately made active ("enforced"). This allows for far smoother
  transitions than in the traditional hard fork paradigm, as well as the 
  collection of test data in the live network environment. This process of
  multi-phased forking was originally to be called "soft forking" but the 
  community affectionately dubbed it "the spork" and the name stuck.

Tainted Coins
  Taint is a measure of correlation between two (wallet) addresses. It
  is only important if the user is trying to remain anonymous.

tAxe
  Test Axe, used on :ref:`testnet <testnet>`.

Testnet
  :ref:`Testnet <testnet>` is a network only for testing (parallel to
  the mainnet), test wallets, test coins, test masternodes, test miners,
  and test users all simulate their mainnet counterparts in a safe
  environment where errors or forks are not harmful.

Tor
  An anonymous routing protocol used by people wanting to hide their
  identity online.

Transaction
  Some movement of data on the distributed blockchain ledger.
  Transactions may be divided into classical and special transactions.
  Similar to Bitcoin, classical transactions move balances between
  addresses on the blockchain. Special transactions contain an extra
  payload in the format defined by `DIP2
  <https://github.com/axerunners/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md>`_, and can
  be used to manage blockchain users, for example.

Transaction Block
  A collection of transactions on the Axe network, gathered into a
  block that can then be hashed and added to the blockchain.

Transaction Fee
  A :ref:`small fee <fees>` imposed on some transactions sent across the
  Axe network. The transaction fee is awarded to the miner that
  successfully hashes the block containing the relevant transaction.

Unconfirmed Transactions
  Transactions that are not yet processed by miners or held via
  InstantSend are "unconfirmed on the blockchain." Unconfirmed
  transactions can be reversed and should not be considered as "final."

Vanity Address
  A Axe address with a desirable pattern, such as a name.

Virgin Axe
  Axe received as a reward for mining a block or running a masternode.
  These have not yet been spent anywhere and are "virgin."

Volatility
  The measurement of price movements over time for a traded financial
  asset (including Axe).

Wallet
  A method of storing Axe for later use. A wallet holds the private
  keys associated with Axe addresses. The blockchain is the record of
  the Axe balances (and transactions) associated with those addresses.

Whitepaper
  A `white paper <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper>`_ is an
  authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a
  complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the
  matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a
  problem, or make a decision.

X11
  :ref:`X11 <x11-hash-algorithm>` is a widely used hashing algorithm
  created by Dash core developer Evan Duffield. X11’s chained hashing
  algorithm utilizes a sequence of eleven scientific hashing algorithms
  for the proof-of-work. This is so that the processing distribution 
  is fair and coins will be distributed
  
Zero Confirmations
  This is a transaction without any confirmations from the blockchain.
  It is technically reversible (unless InstantSend was used).

vin
  A transaction (tx) consists of one or more inputs and one or more
  outputs. The vin is the list of inputs to the transaction, and vout is
  the list of outputs. Masternodes require a 1000 AXE vin (exactly that
  amount) in order to work.

VMN
  Virtual Masternode - a standalone masternode emulator in JavaScript
  that simulates Layer 1-3 Evolution functions for DAP design, development
  and testing.
