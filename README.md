# AXE Documentation

The official Axe documentation is oriented towards the average user and serves to describe all aspects of the Axe ecosystem, ranging from information for new users through to guides on more difficult tasks such as compiling Axe Core from source. This user documentation is available at [docs.axecore.net](https://docs.axecore.net/), while protocol documentation for developers is available separately at [axerunner.github.io](https://axerunner.github.io/).
