========================
Administrative Processes
========================

It's easy to get started integrating Axe, but you will need to make
some decisions about whether you plan to convert your income earned in
Axe into your local fiat currency, or if you prefer to hold some or all
of it in Axe. Most payment processors offer a range of fiat conversion
options, although various fees and limits may be applicable.


Onboarding Process
==================

New merchants typically go through the following steps when joining the
Axe ecosystem:

#. Set up a Axe wallet
#. Identify an appropriate payment processor
#. Decide on how and when to convert funds
#. Implementation and testing
#. Release and marketing
#. Integration on `DiscoverAxe <https://discoveraxe.com>`_


Promoting Axe
==============

A wide range of ready-to-go visual products are available to help you
promote Axe as a payment method to your customers. This includes
promotional graphics and stickers, fonts for consistent visual design
and guidelines on how to use the Axe visual identity. See the
:ref:`Marketing <marketing>` section for more information.

The reduced fees may also offer an additional incentive for your
customers to pay with Axe, particularly in businesses with high cash
handling fees or where it is necessary to add a fee to process credit
card transactions.


Currency Conversion
===================

Cryptocurrency is a relatively recent development, and rapid development
in the ecosystem coupled with various barriers to access and heavy
trading mean that fiat-denominated value is subject to considerable
fluctuation. As a merchant, you will need to make decisions about how
much of your income taken in cryptocurrency should actually be held in
cryptocurrency, and how much should be converted back to a fiat currency
(such as USD) directly. Different payment processors offer different
solutions to this problem.

Services such as `GoCoin <https://gocoin.com>`_ are able to convert a
specified percentage of received payments into a range of fiat
currencies for withdrawal. Others such as `CoinPayments
<https://www.coinpayments.net>`_ offer the ability to diversify your
payments into a range of different cryptocurrencies, but require you to
set up automatic withdrawals to an :ref:`exchange <exchanges>` for
conversion to fiat currency. Finally, services such as `Uphold
<https://uphold.com>`_ allow you to convert your Axe payments between
various currencies and commodities very easily, and even offer automated
investment services.

Note that these listing are not endorsements, and you must complete your
own due diligence and/or seek advice from a tax and investment
specialist before investing.


Legal considerations
====================

Tax, legal and regulatory considerations may be applicable in some
jurisdictions.
