Getting Started
===============

This documentation describes how to use the most common features of the
Axe Copay wallet. Since the functionality isÂ similar across all
supported platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux), the
instructions and screenshots will reference the Android software,
highlighting differences between the platforms where necessary.

The easiest way to install the Axe Copay for Android is from the
Google Play Store.

code yourself, please see the instructions on  `GitHub

Installation
============

When you first start your Axe Copay Wallet, you will be prompted to
choose between creating a new wallet or restoring an existing wallet
from backup. Choose **Get Started** to create a new wallet, unless you
have existing funds stored in another wallet using a recovery phrase.
When prompted, enter and confirm a spending password to encrypt your
wallet keys. You will need this password every time you want to send
Axe from your wallet. At this point, you will be offered a chance to
back up your wallet using a recovery phrase. It is highly recommended to
do this immediately by tapping the **Backup wallet** button. Acknowledge
the warnings, enter your password and write down the displayed recovery
phrase on paper. Do not take a screenshot, since your device will likely
make a copy on cloud storage, which is not necessarily under your
personal control. Confirm the recovery phrase and terms of use. Your
Axe Copay wallet is now ready to go!

*Creating a new wallet and generating the recovery phrase in Axe Copay
wallet*

If you want to restore an existing Axe Copay wallet, simply tap
**Restore from backup** and enter the 12 word recovery phrase. File/text
backups are also supported.

Receiving
=========

Simply tap the **Receive** icon at the bottom of the screen to receive
Axe. The wallet will generate and display a QR code for the other
device to scan, or you can tap the displayed address to copy it to the
clipboard so you can paste it in another app. If you have multiple
wallets, you can see the name of the wallet at the bottom of the screen,
and tap it to switch between wallets. The receiving address will change
and you will receive a notification when you receive the transfer.

Sending
=======

Depending on how your payee has provided their receiving address to you,
you can send Axe by tapping either the **Scan** icon to use the device
camera to scan a QR code, or the **Send** icon to paste a copied address
or select an address from your Axe Copay address book. Once you have
entered the address, it may be possible or necessary to enter the amount
of Axe to be sent or an optional label for the recipient, and to decide
if you want to send with InstantSend on or off (off by default). If you
have multiple wallets, you must also choose which wallet you will use to
send the funds. Once the transaction is complete, you will see a payment
confirmation screen.

open the Insight blockchain explorer to view full transaction details.
All the wallets you have created and their respective balances appear
