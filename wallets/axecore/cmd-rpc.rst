Arguments and commands
======================

All command-line options (except for ``-datadir`` and ``-conf``) may be
specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options
may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override
values set in the configuration file. The configuration file is a list
of ``setting=value`` pairs, one per line, with optional comments
starting with the ``#`` character.

The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it
using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, axe-qt (or axed)
will look for a file named ``axe.conf`` in the axe data directory, but
both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed
using the -datadir and -conf command-line arguments.

+----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note: if running Axe in testnet mode, the sub-folder ``testnet3`` will
be appended to the data directory automatically.

--datadir=<dir>                        Specify data directory
--dbcache=<n>                          Set database cache size in megabytes (4 to 16384, default: 100)
