"Your Axe Core Wallet is associated with a number of unique addresses that "
"can be used to send and receive Axe. Each address holds its own balance, "
"and the sum of all your balances is what appears on the **Overview** tab. "
"When you send Axe, your wallet will automatically transfer funds from as "
"many of your addresses as necessary to the destination address, which is "
"controlled by another Axe user and associated with their wallet. You can "
"control which addresses you use using the Coin Control feature."

"When you confirm a transaction, Axe Core will enter the transaction in a "
"block, which will then be added to the blockchain for other clients to "
"confirm. A transaction is generally considered confirmed once six blocks "
"have been added after the block containing your transaction, although "
"masternode and mining payments are only released after 101 blocks. Note that"
" a different process is used for InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions."

"You can also use the three icons |sendicons| to the right of the **Pay To** "

"again later. Finally, enter the amount of Axe you want to transfer in the "
"**Amount** field."

"The other options relate to fees and PrivateSend/InstantSend. You can choose"
" if you want to pay the network fee in addition to the amount sent, or "
"subtract it from the amount sent. You can also increase your fee to "
"encourage nodes on the network to prioritize your transaction. Choosing "
"**InstantSend** has a similar effect, but actually relies on a different "
"mechanism in the second layer network to speed up the transaction time. "
"Choosing **PrivateSend** will send Axe from an address that has previously "
"been mixed. You can find out more about PrivateSend and InstantSend "
":ref:`here <axecore-privatesend-instantsend>`."
