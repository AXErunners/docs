"Axe is the first cryptocurrency to feature a concept called InstantSend "
"(transaction locking and masternode consensus). This technology will "
"allow cryptocurrencies to compete with nearly instantaneous transaction "
"systems such as credit cards for point-of-sale situations while not "
"relying on a centralized authority. Widespread vendor acceptance of Axe "
"and InstantSend could revolutionize cryptocurrency by shortening the "
"delay in confirmation of transactions from as long as an hour (with "
"Bitcoin) to as little as a few seconds."
