"The open-source Axe Insight REST API provides you with a convenient, "
"powerful and simple way to read data from the Axe network and build your "
"own services with it. Simple HTTP endpoints exist for all common operations "
"on the Axe blockchain familiar from the Bitcore Insight API, as well as "
"Axe-specific features such as InstantSend transactions, budget proposals, "
"sporks and the masternode list. This documentation describes how to set up "
"the `Axe Insight API <https://github.com/axerunners/insight-api>`__ server and"
" (optionally) the `Axe Insight UI <https://github.com/axerunners/insight-"
"ui>`__ block explorer."
