"Axe is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on anonymity and"
" transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these features are "
"implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known as masternodes, "
"which gives rise to many exciting features not available on conventional "
"blockchains. These features include anonymous and instant transactions, as "
"well as governance of the development of the Axe network through a monthly "
"budget and voting. This in itself is a first in the crypto world, and the "
"masternodes are necessary to achieve the privacy and speed that Axe offers."

"達世幣最著名的一點是，它是第一個專注於匿名和交易速度的加密貨幣。許多人不知道的是，這些功能是在稱為主節點的專用服務器網絡之上實現的，這產生了傳統區塊鏈所不具備的許多令人興奮的功能。這些功能包括匿名和即時交易，以及通過每月預算和投票來管理達世幣網絡的開發。這本身就是加密世界中的第一個，並且主節點是實現達世幣所提供的私隱和速度所必需的。"

"This documentation focuses on understanding the services masternodes provide"
" to the network, but also includes guides on how to run a masternode, using "
"either a hosting provider or by setting up and maintaining your own hosting "
"solution. The primary requirement to run a masternode on the Axe network is"
" 1000 AXE. This is known as the collateral, and cannot be spent without "
"interrupting operation of the masternode. The second requirement is the "
"actual server running the Axe masternode software."

"Since operating your own server requires a certain level knowledge of "
"blockchains and Linux server operating systems, several community members "
"offer dedicated hosting solutions for a fee. Taking advantage of these "
"services means the user only needs to provide the masternode collateral and "
"pay the hosting fee in order to receive payment from the block reward. See "
":ref:`these pages <masternode-hosting>` for information on how to set up a "
"hosted masternode."

"Users with a deeper understanding (or curiosity) about the inner workings of"
" the Axe network may choose to operate their own masternode on their own "
"host server. Several steps are required, and the user must assume "
"responsibility for setting up, securing and maintaining both the server and "
"collateral. See these pages for information on how to set up a self-operated"
" masternode."
