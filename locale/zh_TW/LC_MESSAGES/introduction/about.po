"Axe aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused "
"cryptocurrency in the world. The Axe network features :ref:`instant "
"transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, "
":ref:`anonymity <privatesend>` equal to that of physical cash, a :ref:`self-"
"governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` driven by "
":ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a `clear roadmap "
"<https://github.com/axerunners/axe-roadmap>`_ for on-chain scaling to up to "
"400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While Axe is "
"based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the Bitcoin "
"ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant improvements in"
" transaction speed, anonymity and governance. This section of the "
"documentation describes these and many more key features that set Axe apart"
" in the blockchain economy."
