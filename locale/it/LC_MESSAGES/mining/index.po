"Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as Axe refers to the process "
"of searching for solutions to cryptographically difficult problems as a "
"method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of mining creates "
"new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. Mining is possible on a range "
"of hardware. Axe implements an algorithm known as :ref:`X11 <x11-hash-"
"algorithm>`, which the miner must solve in order to earn rewards."

"The simplest and most general hardware available for mining is the general "
"purpose CPU present in every computer. A CPU is designed to be versatile but"
" offers less efficiency than a GPU, which is designed to rapidly calculate "
"millions of vectors in parallel. While specific CPU instruction enhancements"
" related to cryptography such as AES or AVX can provide a decent boost, GPUs"
" offer a significant performance increase due to their multiple pipelines "
"capable of processing the predictably repetitive calculations associated "
"with cryptocurrency mining. Finally, ASICs are relatively inflexible and can"
" only process the specific function(s) for which they were designed, but at "
"an even faster rate than the more general purpose GPUs and CPUs. A number of"
" X11 ASICs are now available on the market, which have quickly made CPU and "
"GPU mining uneconomic due to the increased difficulty of hashing arising "
"from the rapidly increasing hash rate. The result is a currency which is "
"more secure against brute force attacks on the Axe blockchain."

"Axe, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"Axe and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners "
"attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when "
"they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the "
"blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the "
"problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the "
"miner is rewarded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../mining/index.rst:56
msgid ""
"Axe works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a two-"
"tier network. The second tier is powered by :ref:`masternodes <masternodes>`"
" (Full Nodes), which enable financial privacy (PrivateSend), instant "
"transactions (InstantSend), and the decentralized governance and budget "
"system. Because this second tier is so important, masternodes are also "
"rewarded when miners discover new blocks. The breakdown is as follows: 45% "
"of the block reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to masternodes, and 10% is "
"reserved for the budget system (created by superblocks every month)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../mining/index.rst:66
msgid ""
"The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the "
"masternodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the entire "
"network is overseen by the masternodes, which have the power to reject "
"improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire "
"block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the Axe "
"software, the masternode network would orphan that block, and it would not "
"be added to the blockchain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../mining/index.rst:74
msgid ""
"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. Masternodes power the "
"second tier, which provide the added features that make Axe different from "
"other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes do not mine, and mining computers cannot"
" serve as masternodes. Additionally, each masternode is “secured” by 1000 "
"AXE. Those AXE remain under the sole control of their owner at all times, "
"and can still be freely spent. The funds are not locked in any way. However,"
" if the funds are moved or spent, the associated masternode will go offline "
"and stop receiving rewards."
