"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Axe's attempt to "
"solve two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. "
"Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition"
" there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In "
"Axe, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of "
"masternodes. The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once "
"(yes/no/abstain) for each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be "
"implemented (or not) by Axe's developers. A key example is early in "
"2016, when Axe's Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking "
"whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, "
"consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to "
"Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three "
"years and has resulted in serious splits within the community and even "
"forks to the Bitcoin blockchain."

"The DGBB also provides a means for Axe to fund its own development. "
"While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, "
"Axe uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time"
" a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a "
"masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the "
"month. During the month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the "
"network. If that proposal earns the net approval of at least 10% of the "
"masternode network, then at the end of the month the requested amount "
"will be paid out in a \"superblock\". At that time, the block rewards "
"that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used to fund approved "
"proposals. The network thus funds itself by reserving 10% of the block "
"reward for budget projects."
