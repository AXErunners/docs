"Normal transactions in Axe only need to be approved by the person "
"sending the funds. The Axe Copay wallet supports multisig, short for "
"multisignature, meaning that it is possible to require more than one key "
"to approve a transaction. This can be used like a joint checking account,"
" or in situations where majority approval from a board is required to "
"create a transaction. This documentation describes how to set up and use "
"shared wallets."

"Before you create a shared wallet, think about how many people should "
"have access to it, and how many of those people will be required to "
"authorise a transaction. Is it just one or two? Or a majority, or even "
"everyone? Shared wallets allow you to specify a total number of copayers "
"and a required number of signatures to create a transaction. These are "
"often referred to as M-of-N transactions, where for example 2-of-3 "
"signatures are required to transact. In practice, this is used to share "
"responsibility for the funds between several people. It is not possible "
"require a certain person, such as the manager, to be one of the copayers "
"(although adding a password only the manager knows can have the same "
"effect). Shared wallets are inherently risky because if more than the "
"minimum required number of people involved lose access to their keys, the"
" funds will be inaccessible forever. Make sure everyone understands the "
"risks and responsibilities of shared wallets before committing "
"significant funds."

"Funds and addresses in shared wallets are managed separately from your "
"personal wallets, so you will need to create a new wallet and then add "
"copayers before you can begin creating transactions. From the **Home** "
"screen, click the + button at the top right to add a new wallet. Select "
"**Create shared wallet** and enter a name for the wallet, your own name, "
"the total number of copayers and the required number of signatures for a "
"transaction. Tap the **Create m-of-n wallet** button to create the "
"wallet. The wallet will appear with your other wallets, listed as "
"**Incomplete** until the copayers have joined."

"them by email or instant message by tapping the **Share invitation** "
