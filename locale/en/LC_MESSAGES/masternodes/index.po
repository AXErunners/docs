"Axe is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on anonymity "
"and transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these "
"features are implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known "
"as masternodes, which gives rise to many exciting features not available "
"on conventional blockchains. These features include anonymous and instant"
" transactions, as well as governance of the development of the Axe "
"network through a monthly budget and voting. This in itself is a first in"
" the crypto world, and the masternodes are necessary to achieve the "
"privacy and speed that Axe offers."

"This documentation focuses on understanding the services masternodes "
"provide to the network, but also includes guides on how to run a "
"masternode, using either a hosting provider or by setting up and "
"maintaining your own hosting solution. The primary requirement to run a "
"masternode on the Axe network is 1000 AXE. This is known as the "
"collateral, and cannot be spent without interrupting operation of the "
"masternode. The second requirement is the actual server running the Axe "
"masternode software."

"Since operating your own server requires a certain level knowledge of "

" offer dedicated hosting solutions for a fee. Taking advantage of these "
"services means the user only needs to provide the masternode collateral "
"and pay the hosting fee in order to receive payment from the block "
"reward. See :ref:`these pages <masternode-hosting>` for information on "
"how to set up a hosted masternode."

"Users with a deeper understanding (or curiosity) about the inner workings"
