"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Axe's attempt to "
"solve two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. "
"Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition"
" there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In "
"Axe, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of "
"masternodes. The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once "
"(yes/no/abstain) for each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be "
"implemented (or not) by Axe's developers. A key example is early in "
"2016, when Axe's Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking "
"whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, "
"consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to "
"Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three "
"years and has resulted in serious splits within the community and even "
"forks to the Bitcoin blockchain."

#: ../../governance.rst:22
#, python-format
msgid ""
"The DGBB also provides a means for Axe to fund its own development. "
"While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, "
"Axe uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time"
" a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a "
"masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the "
"month. During the month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the "
"network. If that proposal earns the net approval of at least 10% of the "
"masternode network, then at the end of the month the requested amount "
"will be paid out in a \"superblock\". At that time, the block rewards "
"that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used to fund approved "
"proposals. The network thus funds itself by reserving 10% of the block "
"reward for budget projects."

"One of the greatest challenges of building a cryptocurrency platform is "
"ensuring you create a decentralized system of governance to manage, fund,"
" maintain and expand the project. This key element has been absent in "
"every major currency to date, so the natural response is to create a not-"
"for-profit foundation that is tasked with maintaining the core protocol "
"and promoting the coin, but is not really connected to the coin holders "
"in any meaningful way. This approach has a few issues that have been made"
" evident from the experience of older crypto currency platforms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:59
msgid ""
"Current crypto foundations are not related to the currency itself by any "
"mechanism that is included in the protocol and are not designed to "
"outlive early adopters when they lose interest. The foundation then "
"struggles to maintain funding until it implodes and core development of "
"the protocol is left scrambling for funding or depending on charity that "
"can’t be counted on and does not allow for proper budgeting and planning."
" Donations are also unfair to donors because there are always free riders"
" that benefit from the effort done by others without contributing. Other "
"projects have financed themselves by premining coins or running prelaunch"
" sales, which is not a great solution either because control of the funds"
" is centralized and at that stage it is impossible to quantify the future"
" needs of the project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:72
msgid ""
"Through the network of full nodes and the collateral requirement, Axe "
"already has a decentralized network of masternode operators that are "
"heavily invested in the future of the currency, and that as a group can "
"act as stewards of the core protocol development and promotion. We "
"propose a decentralized management system based on the masternode voting "
"mechanism. Masternode operators are not the only ones interested in the "
"success of Axe, but they are the most stable ones because, unlike "
"miners, they can’t reuse their asset for any other purpose or coin."

"In the budget system, a portion of the block reward is held in escrow by "
"the network itself, in the name of the operators, to be executed in the "
"development and expansion of the ecosystem according to the vote of the "
"masternodes in different budget proposals. These funds are directed to "
"supporting development and promotion of the coin. Masternode operators "
"vote on specific budgets and projects to be funded, thus defining the "
"direction the coin is taking. This is done in a completely transparent "
"way through a public portal where new initiatives are proposed and "
"masternodes can vote on them. Functioning like a decentralized "
"Kickstarter or Lighthouse, the budget can be used for anything that "
"creates value within the ecosystem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:93
#, python-format
msgid ""
"This is a 100% decentralized system powered by the masternodes, where "
"budgets are set and paid directly from the blockchain. The blockchain "
"hires core developers in this way and introduces a new concept of paid "
"blockchain contractors, where people work for and are directly "
"compensated by the network, through the decentralized votes of all "
"masternode operators. One advantage of this model is it can survive early"
" adopters. If early masternode operators sell their coins, the new owner "
"can set up a masternode and with it acquire the right to vote on the "
"budgets and projects. This guarantees there is a working system of "
"maintenance as people come and go, making the network capable of "
"sustaining itself on its own without depending on specific actors."

"The system works as a decentralized voting mechanism set up in the rules "
"governing the blockchain, where budgets for specific projects are "
"proposed, then the masternodes as a whole vote on them. Each project, if "
"it passes, is added to the total budget and paid directly from the "
"blockchain to the person doing the work. This allows Axe to hire core "
"developers and pay them directly after approval of the work in a "
"decentralized fashion."

"A masternode votes on a proposal (technically a governance object on the "
"blockchain) using the example command “masternode vote yes”, “masternode "
"vote no” or “masternode vote abstain”. The votes then propagate across "
"the network, and are tallied according to instructions followed by the "
"network itself. Budgets under discussion and voting progress can be "
"viewed using the example command “masternode budget show”."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:123
msgid ""
"A well defined decentralized system of governance allows a cryptocurrency"
" network to endure and survive its original creators. In this way, later "
"generations of masternode operators have a clear way to support the "
"system as defined by the protocol itself, applying wisdom of the crowd "
"techniques and the bond of trust established by the masternode collateral"
" to create a decentralized management system. This creates incredible "
"value within the currency, allowing us to be more agile and compete with "
"other payment systems, such as Bitcoin and credit cards, on a global "
"scale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:133
msgid ""
"As the system has developed, a strong team of productive contractors paid"
" from blockchain rewards has arisen and become established. This includes"
" the core development team, escrow providers, news and reporting staff, "
"experimental development labs, partnerships with universities, hiring of "
"marketing and PR firms and integrations with third party exchanges and "
"payment platforms. The market recognizes the value of the stability of "
"the network as a whole, and that the possibility of reliable and "
"sufficient funding results in faster and more coherent implementation of "

"faster development and promotion, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits"
