"A range of services and businesses are available to convert your wage to "

"automatically convert any received deposits to and from Axe. Building on"
" this functionality, `Bitwage <https://www.bitwage.com>`_ allows you to "
"invoice and receive payment from any employer, practically anywhere in "
"the world, and have a percentage of your wage immediately converted to "
"Axe. You can then withdraw your wage to any Axe wallet for spending or "
"saving. For more information, see the following blog posts:"
