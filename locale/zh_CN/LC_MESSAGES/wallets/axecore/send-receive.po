"Your Axe Core Wallet is associated with a number of unique addresses that "
"can be used to send and receive Axe. Each address holds its own balance, "
"and the sum of all your balances is what appears on the **Overview** tab. "
"When you send Axe, your wallet will automatically transfer funds from as "
"many of your addresses as necessary to the destination address, which is "
"controlled by another Axe user and associated with their wallet. You can "
"control which addresses you use using the Coin Control feature."
msgstr ""
"Axe Core钱包内含一系列用于发送和接收达世币的地址。每个地址都存有一定的余额，而各个地址上的余额会显示在 **总览** "
"选项卡上。如果用户发送达世币，那么钱包将自动将资金从这些地址上转移到收款方的钱包地址上。用户可以通过货币控制功能来选定发送达世币时所用的地址。"

"When you confirm a transaction, Axe Core will enter the transaction in a "
"block, which will then be added to the blockchain for other clients to "
"confirm. A transaction is generally considered confirmed once six blocks "
"have been added after the block containing your transaction, although "
"masternode and mining payments are only released after 101 blocks. Note that"
" a different process is used for InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions."
msgstr ""
"一旦用户确认交易，Axe "
"Core钱包将会把交易录入区块链，以等待其它客户端的确认。在包含该交易的区块链获得六次确认后，交易通常就会被认为已经得到了确认，不过，主节点奖励和矿工奖励往往需要等待101个区块创建之后才能予以确认。值得注意的是，即时发送和匿名发送交易的流程与上述过程有所区别。"

"The other options relate to fees and PrivateSend/InstantSend. You can choose"
" if you want to pay the network fee in addition to the amount sent, or "
"subtract it from the amount sent. You can also increase your fee to "
"encourage nodes on the network to prioritize your transaction. Choosing "
"**InstantSend** has a similar effect, but actually relies on a different "
"mechanism in the second layer network to speed up the transaction time. "
"Choosing **PrivateSend** will send Axe from an address that has previously "
"been mixed. You can find out more about PrivateSend and InstantSend "
":ref:`here <axecore-privatesend-instantsend>`."

"其它选项涉及手续费、匿名发送或即时发送功能。用户可以选择在所汇金额中自动扣除交易费用，也可以选择在汇款之外另行支付。如果希望达世币网络优先处理个人交易，那么用户就需要额外支付交易费用。用户可以选择"
" **即时发送** 功能，不过这个功能需要依靠网络的第二层级的不同机制才能加速交易确认。用户还可以选择 **匿名发送** "
"功能，它将发送经过预先混币的达世币。如需了解有关匿名发送和即时发送的更多信息，请点击\\ :ref:`此处 <axecore-privatesend-"
