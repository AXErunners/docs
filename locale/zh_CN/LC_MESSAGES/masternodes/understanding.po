"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 1000 Axe. The "

"任何个人都可以运行达世币主节点。主节点的目标是提高去中心化程度，从而避免某个人或某一群体掌控大量的主节点。不过，为了防范不必要的主节点或莽撞的持有人，达世币网络要求个人存入1000个达世币用以证明资格，能够持有一个主节点。这笔资金不必绑定在主节点上，但是必须存在达世币网络上并向整个网络公开。一旦持有人将资金提现或支出，主节点将停止运行而关联的区块奖励也将停止支付。"

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the PrivateSend, InstantSend and "

"reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners. "
"Masternodes are selected for payment in each block (approximately every 2.6 "
"minutes) from a deterministic masternode list, and moved to the back of the "
