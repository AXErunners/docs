"While Axe offers stable binary builds on the `website "

"`Jenkins <https://jenkins.docs.axerunners.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/axerunners-axe-"

"Axe binaries for themselves. This process has been greatly simplified with "

"Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Axe "
"Core executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the "
"executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes sure "
"that the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the "
"executable. Multiple developers build the source code by following a "
"specific descriptor (\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and "
"upload the resulting signature. These results are compared and only if they "
"match, the build is accepted and uploaded to docs.axerunners.com."

"Core的可执行文件。Gitian提供有一种方法，可合理地确认可执行文件真实构建自GitHub上的源文件。Gitian还可确保将相同的、经过测试的依赖项应用于可执行文件，并将其静态构建到可执行文件中。多名开发者依照特定的描述符（\"recipe\"）来构建源代码，加密签署结果，并将生成的签名上传。对这些结果进行比较，如果相匹配，则接受构建并上传至docs.axerunners.com。"
