"This documentation describes how to use Axe Core to send Axe anonymously. "
"PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in RC4 of the DarkCoin client and "
"rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of running a "
"sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an external "
"observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a PrivateSend "
"transaction is created. This gives your Axe the same anonymous properties "
"as cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The mixing and denomination "
"process is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part of "
"the user. The current implementation of PrivateSend in the Axe Core wallet "
"allows any amount of Axe to be mixed for later use in PrivateSend "
"transactions. As of December 2018, PrivateSend is not currently available in"
" other Axe wallets."

"InstantSend functions by setting a flag on the transaction, causing "
