"While Axe offers stable binary builds on the `website "
"<https://www.axerunners.com/wallets>`_ and on `GitHub "
"<https://github.com/axerunners/axe/releases>`_, and development builds using "
"`Jenkins <https://jenkins.docs.axerunners.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/axerunners-axe-"
"gitian-nightly/activity/>`_, many users will also be interested in building "
"Axe binaries for themselves. This process has been greatly simplified with "
"the release of Axe Core 1.2.0, and users who do not required deterministic"
" builds can typically follow the `generic build notes "
"<https://github.com/axerunners/axe/blob/develop/doc/build-generic.md>`__ "

"Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Axe "
"Core executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the "
"executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes sure "
"that the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the "
"executable. Multiple developers build the source code by following a "
"specific descriptor (\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and "
"upload the resulting signature. These results are compared and only if they "
"match, the build is accepted and uploaded to docs.axerunners.com."
