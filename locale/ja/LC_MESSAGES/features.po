"Cryptocurrencies such as Axe and Bitcoin are created through a "

"repeatedly solving :ref:`hash algorithms <x11-hash-algorithm>` until a "
"valid solution for the current :ref:`mining difficulty <dark-gravity-"
"wave>` is discovered. Once discovered, the miner is permitted to create "
"new units of the currency. This is known as the block reward. To ensure "
"that the currency is not subject to endless inflation, the block reward "
"is reduced at regular intervals. Graphing this data results in a curve "
"showing total coins in circulation, known as the coin emission rate."

"While Axe is based on Bitcoin, it significantly modifies the coin "

"While Bitcoin reduces the coin emission rate by 50% every 4 years, Axe "
"reduces the emission by one-fourteenth (approx. 7.14%) every 210240 "
"blocks (approx. 383.25 days). It can be seen that reducing the block "
"reward by a smaller amount each year offers a smoother transition to a "
"fee-based economy than Bitcoin."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:77
msgid ""
"X11 is a widely used hashing algorithm created by Axe core developer "
"Evan Duffield. X11’s chained hashing algorithm utilizes a sequence of "
"eleven scientific hashing algorithms for the proof-of-work. This is so "
"that the processing distribution is fair and coins will be distributed in"
" much the same way Bitcoin’s were originally. X11 was intended to make "
"ASICs much more difficult to create, thus giving the currency plenty of "
"time to develop before mining centralization became a threat. This "
"approach was largely successful; as of early 2016, ASICs for X11 now "
"exist and comprise a significant portion of the network hashrate, but "
"have not resulted in the level of centralization present in Bitcoin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:88
msgid ""
"X11 is the name of the chained proof-of-work (**PoW**) algorithm that was"
" introduced in Axe (launched January 2014 as “Xcoin”). It was partially "
"inspired by the chained-hashing approach of Quark, adding further “depth”"
" and complexity by increasing the number of hashes, yet it differs from "
"Quark in that the rounds of hashes are determined *a priori* instead of "
"having some hashes being randomly picked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:95
msgid ""
"The X11 algorithm uses multiple rounds of 11 different hashes (blake, "
"bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo), "
"thus making it one of the safest and more sophisticated cryptographic "
"hashes in use by modern cryptocurrencies."

" graphical interface to Unix/Linux users."

msgid "Advantages of X11"
msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:106
msgid ""
"The increased complexity and sophistication of the chained algorithm "
"provides enhanced levels of security and less uncertainty for a digital "
"currency, compared to single-hash PoW solutions that are not protected "
"against security risks like SPOF (Single Point Of Failure). For example, "
"a possible but not probable computing breakthrough that “breaks” the "
"SHA256 hash could jeopardize the entire Bitcoin network until the network"
" shifts through a hard fork to another cryptographic hash."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:114
msgid ""
"In the event of a similar computing breakthrough, a digital currency "
"using the X11 PoW would continue to function securely unless all 11 "
"hashes were broken simultaneously. Even if some of the 11 hashes were to "
"prove unreliable, there would be adequate warning for a currency using "
"X11 to take measures and replace the problematic hashes with other more "
"reliable hashing algorithms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:121
msgid ""
"Given the speculative nature of digital currencies and their inherent "
"uncertainties as a new field, the X11 algorithm can provide increased "
"confidence for its users and potential investors that single-hash "
"approaches cannot. Chained hashing solutions, like X11, provide increased"
" safety and longevity for store of wealth purposes, investment "
"diversification and hedging against risks associated with single-hash "
"currencies plagued by SPOF (Single Point Of Failure)."

"Evan Duffield, the creator of Axe and X11 chained-hash, has wrote on "
"several occasions that X11 was integrated into Axe not with the "
"intention to prevent ASIC manufacturers from creating ASICs for X11 in "

"had (CPUs, GPUs, ASICs)."

"**DGW** or *Dark Gravity Wave* is an open source difficulty-adjusting "
"algorithm for Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies that was first used in Axe "
"and has since appeared in other digital currencies. DGW was authored by "
"Evan Duffield, the developer and creator of Axe, as a response to a "
"time-warp exploit found in *Kimoto's Gravity Well*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features.rst:152
msgid ""
"In concept, DGW is similar to the Kimoto Gravity Well, adjusting the "
"difficulty levels every block (instead of every 2016 blocks like Bitcoin)"
" based on statistical data from recently found blocks. This makes it "
"possible to issue blocks with relatively consistent times, even if the "
"hashing power experiences high fluctuations, without suffering from the "
"time-warp exploit."
