"X11 is a widely used hashing algorithm created by Axe core developer Evan "

"before mining centralization became a threat. This approach was largely "
"successful; as of early 2016, ASICs for X11 now exist and comprise a "
"significant portion of the network hashrate, but have not resulted in the "

"X11 is the name of the chained proof-of-work (**PoW**) algorithm that was "

"and complexity by increasing the number of hashes, yet it differs from Quark"
" in that the rounds of hashes are determined *a priori* instead of having "
"some hashes being randomly picked."

"The X11 algorithm uses multiple rounds of 11 different hashes (blake, bmw, "
"groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo), thus "

"Transactions on the Axe network are recorded in blocks on the blockchain. "
"The size of each transaction is measured in bytes, but there is not "
"necessarily a correlation between high value transactions and the number of "
"bytes required to process the transaction. Instead, transaction size is "
"affected by how many input and output addresses are involved, since more "
"data must be written in the block to store this information. Each new block "
"is generated by a miner, who is paid for completing the work to generate the"
" block with a block reward. In order to prevent the network from being "
"filled with spam transactions, the size of each block is artificially "
"limited. As transaction volume increases, the space in each block becomes a "
"scarce commodity. Because miners are not obliged to include any transaction "
"in the blocks they produce, once blocks are full, a voluntary transaction "
"fee can be included as an incentive to the miner to process the transaction."
" Most wallets include a small fee by default, although some miners will "
"process transactions even if no fee is included."

"The release of Axe 0.12.2.0 and activation of DIP0001 saw a simultaneous "
"reduction of fees by a factor of 10, while the block size was increased from"
" 1MB to 2MB to promote continued growth of low-cost transactions even as the"
" cost of Axe rises. Axe also supports :ref:`instantsend` and "
":ref:`privatesend` transactions, which operate on a different and mandatory "
"fee schedule. Axe 1.2.0.0 introduced InstantSend autolocks, which causes "
"masternodes to automatically attempt to lock any transaction with 4 or fewer"
" inputs — which are referred to as “simple” transactions — and removes the "
"additional fee for InstantSend. The fee schedule for Axe 0.13.x as of "
"December 2018 is as follows:"

"As an example, a standard and relatively simple transaction on the Axe "
"network with one input, one output and a possible change address typically "
"fits in the range of 200 - 400 bytes. Assuming a price of US$100 per AXE, "
"the fee falls in the range of $0.0002 - $0.0004, or 1/50th of a cent. "
"Processing a simple transaction using InstantSend at the same price is free "
"of charge, while more complex InstantSend transactions may cost around 1-2 "
"cents per transaction, depending on the number of inputs. These fees apply "
"regardless of the Axe or dollar value of the transaction itself."

"PrivateSend works by creating denominations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 "
"AXE and then mixing these denominations with other users. Creation of the "
"denominations is charged at the default fee for a standard transaction. "
"Mixing is free, but to prevent spam attacks, an average of one in ten mixing"
" transactions are charged a fee of 0.0001 AXE. Spending inputs mixed using "
"PrivateSend incurs the usual standard or InstantSend fees, but to avoid "
"creating a potentially identifiable change address, the fee is always "
"rounded up to the lowest possible denomination. This is typically .001 AXE,"
" so it is important to deduct the fee from the amount being sent if possible"
" to minimise fees. Combining InstantSend and PrivateSend may be expensive "
"due to this requirement and the fact that a PrivateSend transaction may "
"require several inputs, while InstantSend charges a fee of 0.0001 AXE per "
"input. Always check your fees before sending a transaction."

"`Axe Evolution <https://www.axerunners.com/evolution/>`_ is the code name for a "
"decentralized currency platform built on Axe blockchain technology. The "
"goal is to provide simple access to the unique features and benefits of Axe"
" to assist in the creation of decentralized technology. Axe introduces a "
"tiered network design, which allows users to do various jobs for the "
"network, along with decentralized API access and a decentralized file "

" including a basic implementation of AxeDrive, Primitives, DAPI and a "
