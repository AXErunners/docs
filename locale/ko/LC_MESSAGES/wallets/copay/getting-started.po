"When you first start your Axe Copay Wallet, you will be prompted to choose "
"between creating a new wallet or restoring an existing wallet from backup. "
"Choose **Get Started** to create a new wallet, unless you have existing "
"funds stored in another wallet using a recovery phrase. When prompted, enter"
" and confirm a spending password to encrypt your wallet keys. You will need "
"this password every time you want to send Axe from your wallet. At this "
"point, you will be offered a chance to back up your wallet using a recovery "
"phrase. It is highly recommended to do this immediately by tapping the "
"**Backup wallet** button. Acknowledge the warnings, enter your password and "
"write down the displayed recovery phrase on paper. Do not take a screenshot,"
" since your device will likely make a copy on cloud storage, which is not "
"necessarily under your personal control. Confirm the recovery phrase and "
"terms of use. Your Axe Copay wallet is now ready to go!"

"sent or an optional label for the recipient, and to decide if you want to "
"send with InstantSend on or off (off by default). If you have multiple "
