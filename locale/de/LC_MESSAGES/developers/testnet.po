"With the release of Axe Core 12.3, Axe added support for a great new "
"feature — **named devnets**. Devnets are developer networks that combine "
"some aspects of testnet (the global and public testing network) and some "
"aspects of regtest (the local-only regression testing mode that provides "
"controlled block generation). Unlike testnet, multiple independent devnets "
"can be created and coexist without interference. For practical documentation"
" on how to use devnets, see the `developer documentation <https://axe-"
"docs.github.io/en/developer-examples#devnet-mode>`__ or this `blog post "

"using identical versions of the software before they are carried out on the "
