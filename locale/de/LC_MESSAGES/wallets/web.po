"`MyAxeWallet <https://myaxewallet.org/>`_ is a web interface to the Axe "
"blockchain, inspired by `MyEtherWallet <https://www.myetherwallet.com>`_ and"
" created by `DeltaEngine.net <https://deltaengine.net/>`_. It is explicitly "
"not an online wallet, meaning you maintain control over your private keys at"
" all times. Unlike many other light wallets, MyAxeWallet also supports "
"advanced Axe features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend. The project is "
"non-profit, open source and free to use. You can load a wallet and transact "
"in a variety of wallet formats:"
